# Three-Phase Voltage Simulation and Fresnel Diagram

This project contains two MATLAB scripts for **visualizing three-phase AC systems**.  

The project demonstrates both **time-domain waveforms** and their equivalent **phasor (Fresnel) representation**, which are fundamental tools in electrical engineering.

## Files
### `TPVG.m` – Three-phase voltage graph
This script simulates a **balanced three-phase voltage source** and plots the sinusoidal waveforms of the three phases.

### 2. `TPVPD.m` – Three-phase voltage phasor diagram
This script represents the same three-phase voltages in the **complex plane** using phasors (Fresnel diagram).  
Phasors are vectors that simplify AC analysis by showing magnitude and phase angle.
